%% Text of abstract (Ca 100 words)
Splipy is a pure python library for the creation, evaluation and manipulation of B-spline and NURBS geometries.
It supports $n$-variate splines of any dimension, but emphasis is made on the use of curves, surfaces and volumes.
The library is designed primarily for analysis use, and therefore allows fine-grained control over many aspects which is not possible to achieve with conventional CAD tools.

\section{Motivation and significance}
\label{sec:motivation}

Non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) have been a staple technology in \emph{computer aided design} (CAD) for many decades (CITATION NEEDED).
Their mathematical precision allows the user to create smooth parametric descriptions of curves and surfaces, which is necessary in many engineering applications.
Recent years has seen an increased interest in the use of B-splines and NURBS directly in high-fidelity physics simulations such as the finite element method, thereby uniting geometric modelling and analysis.
The groundbreaking work for these methods, termed \emph{isogeometric analysis} (IGA) can be found in \cite{hughes2005iac}.
While commercial CAD tools do well to facilitate NURBS-based modelling, IGA requires finer control of discretization details, and these are often hidden from the user.
We propose Splipy as a modern easy-to-use Python library that will allow scientist and engineers the detailed control that they need to not only make B-spline meshes that are optimized for analysis, but also work well for modelling.

The software allows for rapid generation of high-quality meshes that can be used directly in IGA programs.
While Splipy offers everything needed in terms of basis function evaluations, derivatives etc.~to build a stand-alone finite element solver, we envision that most users will be content to generate the geometry in Splipy followed by exporting to external solvers.

\section{Software description}
\label{sec:description}

The core tenet of Splipy is the manipulation of \emph{spline objects}, by which is meant a mapping from a $n$-dimensional \emph{parameter space},
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:paramspace}
  \mathcal{P} = [l_1, r_1] \times [l_2, r_2] \times \cdots \times [l_n, r_n]
\end{equation}
into \emph{physical space} $\mathbb{R}^d$.
Conventionally, $d \geq n$.
In spline terms, each parameter interval $[l_i, r_i]$ is subdivided into a \emph{knot vector}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:knotvector}
  l_i = k_0 \leq k_1 \leq k_2 \leq \cdots \leq k_{n_i} = r_i,
\end{equation}
with nondecreasing \emph{knots} $k_j$.
Given a knot vector and a polynomial degree $p_i$, there is a unique B-spline basis $B_j(x_i)$ defined on the interval $[l_i, r_i]$.
Each basis function $B_j$ is piecewise polynomial with degree $p_i$ in all knot intervals $[k_m, k_{m+1}]$, and is supported on exactly $p_i+1$ such intervals.

Given a choice of knot vector and degree for each direction $i=1,\ldots,n$, the full B-spline basis is defined on $\mathcal{P}$ as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:bspline-multi}
  B_{j_1,\ldots,j_n}(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = B_{j_1}(x_1) \cdots B_{j_n}(x_n)
\end{equation}
and a \emph{spline object} is nothing more than a function in the span of this basis, i.e.~a function $s: \mathcal{P} \to \mathbb{R}^d$ such that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:splineobj}
  s(\bm x) = \sum_{j_1, \ldots, j_n} \bm c_{j_1, \ldots, j_n} B_{j_1, \ldots, j_n}(\bm x).
\end{equation}
Here, the coefficients $\bm c_{j_1, \ldots, j_n} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ are termed \emph{control points}.

Splipy is concerned with the creation and manipulation of these mappings and the objects they represent (that is, the image of $\mathcal{P}$ by $s$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$).
With the intended emphasize on analysis: fine control over both the knot vectors and control points are provided.
These quantities dictates the properties of the parametric representation and the geometric mapping respectively.

\subsection{Software Architecture}
\label{sec:architecture}

There are three main classes which are exposed to the user: \texttt{Curve}, \texttt{Surface} and \texttt{Volume}.
All inherit from the \texttt{SplineObject} superclass, which contains common methods such as affine transformations, evaluation and get methods.
See Figure~\ref{fig:hierarchy}.
It is possible to create such spline objects manually, by specifying knot vectors and control points, however most users will be using a wide range of ``factory'' functions.
These can be found in the submodules \texttt{curve\_factory}, \texttt{surface\_factory} and \texttt{volume\_factory}.
More advanced geometries can then be created by using the rich interface for manipulating spline objects.
Generally Splipy scripts follow a bottom-up construction scheme where curves are created from points, surfaces are created from curves and finally volumes are created from the surfaces.

\subsection{Software Functionalities}
\label{sec:functionality}

The library allows for rapid creation of elementary mathematical constructs such as line, circle, disc, sphere, torus, cylinder and teapots.
For sphere geometries (univariate, bivariate and trivariate), multiple discretizations are available.

We now elaborate on a few selected functions.

\subsubsection{Adaptive Curve fitting}
\label{sec:adaptive-curve-fit}
For parametric representation of some target curve $x(t)$ we provide a \texttt{fit} function in \texttt{curve\_factory} which employs a posteriori error estimation to provide a best fit $x_h(t)$ to the curve.
It is a four-stage iterative algorithm which works as follows:
Start with a uniform knot vector; for the current release this knot vector is cubic and contains 10  basis functions.
\\ \textbf{step 1:}
Compute the Greville abscisscae $t^*_i = \sum_{j=i}^{i+p} k_j$ and interpolate on these points $x(t_i^*) = x_h(t_i^*)$.
\\ \textbf{step 2:}
Compute the error $\|x(t)-x_h(t)\|_{L^2(k_i,k_{i+1})}$ for all knot spans $(k_i,k_{i+1})$
\\ \textbf{step 3:}
For all knot spans $(k_i,k_{i+1})$, compute the expected error $\varepsilon_i$ and interpolation error $\varepsilon_{h,i}$ defined as
\begin{eqnarray}
    \varepsilon_i     & = & \frac{k_{i+1} - k_i}{k_n - k_0}\varepsilon \\
    \varepsilon_{h,i} & = & \int_{k_i}^{k_{i+1}} x(t) - x_h(t)\quad dt
\end{eqnarray}
where $\varepsilon$ is some user-defined global tolerance
\\ \textbf{step 4:}
Since we know that our approximation (INSERT CITATION) to converge wrt the knot span size $h=k_{i+1}-k_i$ as $\|x(t)-x_h(t)\|_{L^2} = \mathcal{O}(h^{p+1})$ with $p$ our spline degree, we expect that inserting
\begin{equation}
    n = 2^{-(p+1)}\frac{\varepsilon_{h,i}}{\varepsilon_i}
\end{equation}
new knots will give us the target error.
These knots are then inserted into their relevant knot span and a new interpolation is computed.

These iterations are carried out until the global tolerance is achieved.

\subsubsection{Interior from edges}
\label{sec:interior-from-edges}

\subsubsection{Sphere parametrization}
\label{sec:sphere}
It is well known that perfect circles cannot be represented as B-splines, but can be represented as non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS).
However, there is multiple ways of parametrizing the circle and its surface and volume equivalent.
In particular, we can do a polar parametrization which would include a geometric singularity point at the origin, or one might do what is dubbed a ``square'' parametrization which computes the interior of the four edge curves given by 4 circle segments.
These can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:surface-disc} along with a hybrid parametrization which uses 5 different patches.
Note that the square parametrization, have a singular Jacobian at its four corners, where the isocurves in both parametric directions are parallel.
Depending on where you would need optimal parametrization: the origin or the outer boundary, one might chose one or the other parametrization.

The volumetric parametrization of the sphere, does also have a ``square'' version which avoids the north- and south-pole singularity given by a spherical coordinate parametrization.
For details on the derivation of this particular parametrization, see Cobb \cite{cobb1988tts}.
These are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:volume-disc}

\section{Illustrative Examples}
\label{sec:naca}

The following describes in brief detail the meshing of a NREL 5MW reference wind turbine blade \cite{Jonkman2009drw}.
NACA wing profile is created in accordance with \cite{abbott1959tow}
The blade is defined as a collection airfoils placed at increasing distance form the origin.
Each airfoil has a certain shape (most of them being NACA or DU standardized airfoils), size and angle of attack.
Splipy's cubic spline curve interpolation routines make it easy to describe each airfoil as a periodic spline object with consistent discretization (that is, equal knot vectors), whereupon the whole blade can be lofted in one operation, see Figure~\ref{fig:airfoils} (left) and (CITATION NEEDED).

Since the objective of the exercise is to perform simulations of airfoil around the blade, it is also necessary to create a volumetric mesh surrounding the blade.
At each airfoil, a cylindrical curve is generated at a certain constant radius, again with the same consistent discretization as the airfoils.
The surface between the airfoil and the cylinder is then mapped using a technique known as \emph{orthogonal transfinite interpolation}, see \cite{Fonn2015sbm} for details.
The ``front curve'' of the airfoil is at each stage mapped orthogonally out onto the next stage, and then smoothed, see Figure~\ref{fig:airfoils} (right).
The final surface object is then the result of lofting each of these stages together, and the complete volumetric mesh is similarly created from the lofting of all the surfaces.

This method illustrates the standard strategy of building geometry ``dimension by dimension'', from curves via surfaces to volumes.
Splipy's curve manipulation functions make it easy to implement this rather involved algorithm in a robust and clear manner.

\section{Impact}
\label{sec:impact}

Isogeometric analysis was introduced in 2005 \cite{hughes2005iac} for applying native B-spline basis functions for both the geometry and finite element solution.
One of the limiting factors of this endeavor has been that there have been sparse support for high quality B-spline mesh generation.
Traditional meshing tools used for finite element technologies typically produce Lagrangian piecewise linear simplexes such as tetrahedrons.
Commercial software typically allow the user to create low-quality geometries containing gaps, overlaps and non-matching interfaces.
These are often referred to as ``dirty'' geometries by the industry, and while it is possible to create analysis suitable meshes, the process is currently tedious and time-consuming.

We hope that by this package allows researchers and engineers, especially in the isogeometric community, to consider more complex geometries.

While the package is a library and does not contain a dedicated graphical user interface (GUI), one should be able to create a CAD interface on top of it.
We note that of particular interest is FreeCAD, which is an open source CAD software and supports python plugins.
It would not be unreasonable to see a FreeCAD plugin of splipy that would greatly increase its utility and user-friendliness.

\textbf{This is the main section of the article and the reviewers weight the description here appropriately}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Indicate in what way new research questions can be pursued as a result of the software (if any).
  \item Indicate in what way, and to what extent, the pursuit of existing research questions is improved (if so).
  \item Indicate in what way the software has changed the daily practice of its users (if so).
  \item Indicate how widespread the use of the software is within and outside the intended user group.

\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Splipy is a python programming library which empowers users to work with B-spline and NURBS representations of geometries.
It will lower the barrier of entry to create complex geometric shapes.
It allows for fine-grained control over parametrizations to ensure high-quality meshes which are tailored specifically for analysis.
