\begin{document}
\frontmatter
This class is a simple subclass of \texttt{sintefprojectoffer}, to whose
documentation you are referred.

The classes are such that it is possible to transform a proposal into an
offer simply by changing the document class in the preamble; everything
else will stay the same.

The only substantial difference between a proposal and an offer is the
presence of the disclaimer on the bottom of the first page, which states
that the proposal is not legally binding.
