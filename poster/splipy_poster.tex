\section*{Introduction}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=sintefblue!10!white,colframe=sintefblue,title=Abstract]
  Splipy is a pure python library for the creation, evaluation and manipulation of B-spline and NURBS geometries.
  It supports $n$-variate splines of any dimension, but emphasis is made on the use of curves, surfaces and volumes.
  The library is designed primarily for analysis use, and therefore allows fine-grained control over many aspects which is not possible to achieve with conventional CAD tools.
\end{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Keywords:} NURBS, B-splines, CAD, Interpolation, Approximation

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white,colframe=sintefblue,title=Installation]
  The package is distributed through the Python Package Index (PyPI) and can be installed by typing
  \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=sinteflightgrey]
  \begin{verbatim}
> pip install splipy \end{verbatim}
  \end{tcolorbox}
  into the commandline; or anaconda promt
\end{tcolorbox}
The current release is version 1.3

\section{B-splines}
Given a knot vector of nondecreasing knots $\Xi=[\xi_1, \xi_2, \xi_3, ... \xi_{n+p+1}]$ we define the set of $n$ basisis functions by
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=sintefblue!10!white,colframe=sintefblue,title=The basis]
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:bspline}
    N_{i,p}(\xi) = \frac{\xi - \xi_i}{\xi_{i+p}-\xi_i}N_{i,p-1}(\xi) + \frac{\xi_{i+p+1}-\xi}{\xi_{i+p+1}-\xi_{i+1}}N_{i+1,p-1}(\xi),
  \end{equation}
  and,
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:bspline-start}
    N_{i,0}(\xi) = \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      1  &  $if $ \ \ \xi \in [\xi_i, \xi_{i+1}) \\
      0  &  $else$
    \end{array}
    \right.
  \end{equation}
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Bi- and trivariate Splines}
By creating a tensor product of two or three univariate splines, we are able to create surface and solid representations, i.e.
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{F}(\xi,\eta) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \mathbf{B}_{i,j} N_{i,p}(\xi)N_{j,q}(\eta)
\end{equation}
for bivariate surfaces.
This allows us to generate mappings from the reference coordinates $(\xi,\eta,\zeta)$ which forms a regular rectangle or box into a complex geometry in physical space given by $(x,y,z)$-coordinates.

Non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) have been a staple technology in \emph{computer aided design} (CAD) for many decades (CITATION NEEDED).
Their mathematical precision allows the user to create smooth parametric descriptions of curves and surfaces, which is necessary in many engineering applications.
Recent years has seen an increased interest in the use of B-splines and NURBS directly in high-fidelity physics simulations such as the finite element method, thereby uniting geometric modelling and analysis.
The groundbreaking work for these methods, termed \emph{isogeometric analysis} (IGA) can be found in \cite{hughes2005iac}.
While commercial CAD tools do well to facilitate NURBS-based modelling, IGA requires finer control of discretization details, and these are often hidden from the user.
We propose Splipy as a modern easy-to-use Python library that will allow scientist and engineers the detailed control that they need to not only make B-spline meshes that are optimized for analysis, but also work well for modelling.

The software allows for rapid generation of high-quality meshes that can be used directly in IGA programs.
While Splipy offers everything needed in terms of basis function evaluations, derivatives etc.~to build a stand-alone finite element solver, we envision that most users will be content to generate the geometry in Splipy followed by exporting to external solvers.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white,colframe=sintefblue,title=Integration with Nutils]
  The package is distributed through the Python Package Index (PyPI) and can be installed by typing
  \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=sinteflightgrey]
  \begin{verbatim}
import splipy.surface_factory as sf
from nutils import *
surf = sf.disc(r=3, center=(2,2))
domain = mesh.rectilinear(surf.knots())
ns = Namespace()
ns.cp = splipy_to_nutils(surf)
ns.phi = domain.basis('spline', p=2)
ns.x = 'phi_n cp_ni'
A = domain.integrate(ns.eval_ij('phi_i,k phi_j,k'))
u = A.solve() \end{verbatim}
  \end{tcolorbox}

The poster title is set to be in SINTEF blue and \verb|\huge| size.

All class options will be passed to \texttt{sciposter}, so you should refer to
its documentation on CTAN, however some sensible defaults were chosen for you:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Font size is set to \texttt{36pt}. The default for \texttt{sciposter} is
        ludicrously small, unless you have bad results and want no one to read
        them.
  \item Sections are a bit more sober than the default in \texttt{sciposter}
        (\texttt{plainsections} option).
        If you choose to use the block layout, the colours have already been
        changed to SINTEF corporate colors.
  \item The SINTEF logo automatically appears in the left corner.
        This can be overridden with \verb|\leftlogo{}| or \verb|\noleftlogo|.
\end{itemize}

{\texttt{pgfplots} package} makes it easy to keep the same font style and size
in plots as in the text.
