# Welcome to the SINTeX project!



### About SINTeX

SINTeX is a project that attempts to create up-to-date LaTeX equivalents of the
SINTEF template styles. This includes presentations, project reports, project
offers, and so on.



### Using SINTeX

Further documentation and tips on use can be found on the [confluence page for
LaTeX use in Sintef][confluence]. This page contains further information on the
use of LaTeX. In particular, you can find the
[installation instructions for SINTeX][sintex-install].

In order to use SINTeX, it is required that you have a working
[TeX Live][texlive] installation on your machine. Other LaTeX distributions
may work, but are unsupported at this time. Installation instructions can
be found in [this confluence page][texlive-install].

### Improving SINTeX

If you have improvement suggestions or bug reports, you can report these in
[JIRA][sintex-jira]. The best way to get things fixed, however, is to fix it
yourself and submit a pull request on [Sintef's bitbucket][bitbucket].
